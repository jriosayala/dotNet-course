1. Classes
Exercise: Create a Student class with properties like Name, RollNumber, and Grade. Implement methods to display student details and calculate the grade based on marks. Create a Classroom class that contains a list of Student objects and methods to add, remove, and list students.

2. Association between Classes
Exercise: Create a Library class that contains a list of Book objects. Implement methods to add a book, remove a book, and list all books in the library.

3. Inheritance - Second Pillar of OOP
Exercise: Create a base class Vehicle with properties like Make, Model, and Year. Derive two classes Car and Motorcycle from Vehicle, each with additional properties specific to them. Implement methods to display details of each vehicle.

4. Polymorphism: Third Pillar of OOP
Exercise: Extend the previous exercise by adding a method StartEngine() in the Vehicle class. Override this method in the Car and Motorcycle classes to provide specific implementations. Create a list of Vehicle objects and demonstrate polymorphism by calling StartEngine() on each object.

5. Interfaces
Exercise 1: Define an interface IPlayable with methods Play() and Pause(). Implement this interface in two classes MusicPlayer and VideoPlayer. Demonstrate the use of the interface by creating objects of both classes and calling the methods.

Exercise 2: Create a base class Employee with properties like Name, EmployeeID, and Salary. Derive two classes Manager and Developer from Employee, each with additional properties specific to them. Implement an interface IWorkable with methods Work() and TakeBreak(). Implement this interface in both Manager and Developer classes. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a list of Employee objects and calling the Work() method on each object.
